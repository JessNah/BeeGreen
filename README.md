- Register for an [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42793&eventid=cfc-2020?cm_mmc=OSocial_Blog-_-Audience+Developer_Developer+Conversation-_-WW_WW-_-cfc-2020-ghub-starterkit-cooperation_ov75914&cm_mmca1=000039JL&cm_mmca2=10008917) account.
- Install and configure [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#overview).
- Clone this repo [repository](https://github.com/JessNah/BeeGreen)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (We recommended using v10 or above).
   Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) if you wish to install via package manager.
  - If you're on a macOS, we recommend using

### Starting the Extension dev server

To test your changes, navigate to the Extension folder in your local cloned repo directory, ie. `Github/BeeGreen/Extension`, and then you will need to run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This will build and transpile the Extension code, the output will be placed in the `Extension/dist` folder.

### Loading The Extension on Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Toggle on `Developer mode` in the top right corner
3. Click `Load unpacked`
4. Select the entire `dist` folder

### Start contributing code

#### 1. Understand our Git workflow model

When it comes to code contributions, we generally follow the Gitflow workflow model: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow.

#### 2. Always work on a branch

When contributing to this package, your work should always be done in a new branch. We use feature branches.

What are feature branches: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

Each new feature should always reside in its own branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into the master branch.

When your work is done, submit your pull request and once it has been approved, you can merge your branch.


#### Branch Naming Conventions
Follow this pattern exactly so that searching is easier:
`<prefix>/<summary>` 

Prefix  |   Use Case
---     |   ---
feature |   New feature addition
defect	|   Bug or defect fix
wip	    |   Works in progress
junk    |	  Throwaway branch created to experiment

Example branch name:

```bash
feature/rewards-page
```
