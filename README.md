## Overview
Tackling climate change requires a concerted effort from each individual. Our shopping habits punish or reward food producers and distributors. We wish to empower consumers to make educated choices based on the greenhouse gas emissions, land use and other sustainability factors.
### Problem Background
Shoppers are willing to spend more to purchase items produced sustainably. They lack the information to make these choices. Empowering consumers to make the best choices has the potential to change the landscape of retail and transport, and create more demand for sustainable products while reducing demand for eco-villains.

## The Solution
A database with sustainability metrics on common consumer staples that can be queried from any shopping cart through a simple Chrome browser extension will deliver product comparisons and score the shopping cart. The consumer will be prompted to substitute more sustainable products for high emissions products.

## Try the extension

Do you want to try out our extension and get a preview of the experience, without needing to connect to a server and without having to set up a dev environment? Then follow these steps:

1. Download the `Extension/distProduction` zip file found in this repository, and unzip the folder.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Toggle on `Developer mode` in the top right corner
4. Click `Load unpacked`
5. Select the entire `distProduction` folder

**Note: For real data, you'd have to follow the instructions in the contributing section, as you'd need to connect to a database.

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

Before contributing to this repository, you will need the following tools installed:

- Register for an [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42793&eventid=cfc-2020?cm_mmc=OSocial_Blog-_-Audience+Developer_Developer+Conversation-_-WW_WW-_-cfc-2020-ghub-starterkit-cooperation_ov75914&cm_mmca1=000039JL&cm_mmca2=10008917) account.
- Install and configure [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#overview).
- Clone this repo [repository](https://github.com/JessNah/BeeGreen)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (We recommended using v10 or above).
   Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) if you wish to install via package manager.
  - If you're on a macOS, we recommend using
    [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to help manage different versions of
    Node.js
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Learn more about Git [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git).

### Starting the Extension dev server

To test your changes, navigate to the Extension folder in your local cloned repo directory, ie. `Github/BeeGreen/Extension`, and then you will need to run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This will build and transpile the Extension code, the output will be placed in the `Extension/dist` folder.

If you do not have the database up and connected to the server code, and do not wish to use the real data from the database, then you'd need to first navigate to `Extension/src/settings.ts` and update the `devMode` attribute to `true` before you run the above commands. Otherwise you could follow the steps below to get your server and database up and working.

### Loading The Extension on Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Toggle on `Developer mode` in the top right corner
3. Click `Load unpacked`
4. Select the entire `dist` folder

### Provision a CouchDB instance using Cloudant

Log into the IBM Cloud and provision a [CouchDB instance using Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant).

1. From the catalog, select Databases and then the Cloudant panel.
1. Once selected, you can choose your Cloudant plan -- there is a free tier for simple testing that is sufficient to run this CIR example. You should choose an appropriate region, give the service a name, and it is recommended you choose **Use only IAM** under **Available authentication methods**. You can leave the other settings with their defaults. Click the blue **Create** button when ready.
1. Once your Cloudant instance has been created, you need to create a service credential that the CIR API Server can use to communicate with it. By selecting your running Cloudant instance, you can choose **Service credentials** from the left-hand menu. Create a new service credential and give it a name (it doesn't matter what you call it).
1. Once created, you can display the credentials by selecting **view service credentials**, and then copy the credential, so you are ready to paste it into the code of the API server in the next step.

### Setup the back-end server

To set up and launch the server application:

1. Go to the `BeeGreen/Server` directory of the cloned repo.
2. Update the fields in BeeGreen/Server/src/datasources/beegreendb.datasource with the values created in the previous step.
   
```
{
  name: 'beegreendb',
  connector: 'cloudant',
  url: 'xxx',
  database: 'beegreendb',
  username: 'xxx',
  password: 'xxx',
  modelIndex: 'loopback__model__beegreendb',
  globalLimit: 1000
};
```

3. Run the following command

```
npm install
```

### Setup the client site

From a terminal:

  1. Go to the `BeeGreen/Client` directory of the cloned repo.
  2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.

### Start the client Bee Green site and the back-end server

 1. Go to the Go to the `BeeGreen/Client` directory of the cloned repo.
 2. Launch the server application locally or deploy to IBM Cloud:
     - To run locally:
         1. Start the application: `npm start`.
         2. The client server can be accessed at <http://localhost:3000>.
         3. The back-end server can be accessed at <http://localhost:3001>.
     - To deploy to IBM Cloud:
         1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account using the IBM Cloud CLI: `ibmcloud login`.
         2. Target a Cloud Foundry org and space: `ibmcloud target --cf`.
         3. Push the app to IBM Cloud: `ibmcloud app push`.
         4. The server can be accessed at a URL using the **name** given in the `manifest.yml` file (for example,  <https://my-app-name.bluemix.net>).

### Start contributing code

#### 1. Understand our Git workflow model

When it comes to code contributions, we generally follow the Gitflow workflow model: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow.

#### 2. Always work on a branch

When contributing to this package, your work should always be done in a new branch. We use feature branches.

What are feature branches: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

Each new feature should always reside in its own branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into the master branch.

When your work is done, submit your pull request and once it has been approved, you can merge your branch.


#### Branch Naming Conventions
Follow this pattern exactly so that searching is easier:
`<prefix>/<summary>` 

Prefix  |   Use Case
---     |   ---
feature |   New feature addition
defect	|   Bug or defect fix
wip	    |   Works in progress
junk    |	  Throwaway branch created to experiment

Example branch name:

```bash
feature/rewards-page
```
